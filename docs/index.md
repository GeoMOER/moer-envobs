  excerpt: "At the end of this course you should be able
  
    * to formulate guiding questions and model a schematic data analysis workflow in order to solve a real-life problem, 
	
	* to design and test scalable processing routines which implement your analysis workflow,
	
	* to communicate your analysis methods and results,
	
	* to critically evaluate your analysis results by comparing them to existing findings or theories,
	
	* to reflect your data analysis workflow for potential improvements.

Environmental observations are one of the key data resources in Geography. Transforming this data into information is essential for knowledge generation and informed decision making. Data analysis methods are powerful tools but they have to be applied with caution in order to gain robust results. Building on already advanced data handling, GIS and remote sensing skills, this course provides room for an intensive experience in contemporary environmental data analysis.

# Course features

The course is intended as a blended learning module in our study program. The provided introductions, explanations and examples might also be useful for self-study.



# Syllabus

| Session | Topic | Content |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Questions, hypothesis and workflow | Get a project idea, find guiding questions and model the workflow. |
| 2 | Standing on the shoulders of (messy) giants | Screen existing solutions and find your way on building upon them. |
| 3 | Exemplary analysis  | Complement the workflow to match your objectives. |
| 4 | Testing and fixing | Test your workflow and prepare for large scale computations. |
| 5 | Overviews and in-depth analysis | Separate the important from the unimportant information. |
| 6 | Discuss the results | Evaluate the results and relate them to existing theories and knowledge. |
| 7 | Communicate your findings | Document your methods and results |
| 8 | What have i done? | Reflect your work and discuss potential improvements |
| 9 | Wrap up | Feedback and goodbye |



# Deliverables

The course requires to solve problems provided as part of irregular assignments and the composition of a final essay. The essay should introduce, discuss and reflect the topics of the syllabus.
