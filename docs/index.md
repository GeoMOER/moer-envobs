Data analysis is a key competence of professional geographers but it requires profound knowledge in both (statistical) analysis methods and computer sciences. While the reason for the former is obvious, the latter is a direct result of a growing data deluge, induced by technological progress on both the field of data collection and the one of data distribution.
